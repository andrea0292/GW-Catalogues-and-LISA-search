# GW Catalogues and LISA search
I give here some notebooks to calculate the number of events above some SNR threshold for LISA. I also have a notebook to build a full catalogue with last year LIGO posteriors. I was too lazy to clean things up and there may be typos, I apologize in advance =) 
These Notebooks have been developed also with my friend Laura Sberna, PhD student at Perimeter Institute https://sites.google.com/view/laurasberna.
